# Building & Deploying a Static Blog with Gatsby and Strapi for Free

Strapi is a headless Content Management System (CMS) that will function as the backend to our blog. You can login to Strapi through an Admin panel and add all of your blog post, author and category content. Strapi then makes this content data available through an API that you can grab with the frontend of your choice.

Gatsby is a frontend React framework that we will use to query the Strapi content with GraphQL. Gatsby is a static site generator and will use this content to build out a series of webpages including all of the blog posts.

We will investigate free options to deploy both Strapi and Gatsby with online services so that users can add content and view the final blog.
